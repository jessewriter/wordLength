# wordLength

This was a fun project that I did after taking Duke University's Java course url https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data/ .  This is a fantastic course by the way and even if you are an advanced programmer there are still some gems to pick up or review for Java computer science basics.

Key learning from this project is manipulating and using arrays, looping and conditional logic.

When the tests are ran console will remind you which text file to open then using the provided methods an array will be returned with counts for the lengths of each word in the text file.  Apostrophe and dash are included in the word size but not spaces or quotation marks.

The library FileResources by Duke University is a fantastic library for opening up a gui to locate a local file and very easy to use.
