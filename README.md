# wordLength

This was a fun project that I did after taking Duke Universities Java course.
Key elements of this project is manipulating and using arrays.

When the tests are ran console will remind you which text file to open then using the provided methods an array will be returned with counts for the lengths of each word in the text file.  Apostrophe and dash are included in the word size but not spaces or quotation marks.
